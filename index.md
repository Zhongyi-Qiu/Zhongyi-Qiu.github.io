## About Me
My name is Zhongyi Qiu, and I am a master's student in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Beihang University </a> in China. My research interest includes Electro-hydraulic servo system nonlinear control and Nonlinear data drive control. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof.<a href="https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/liuxiaochao/en/index.htm" target="_blank"> Xiaochao Liu</a>. I will be graduating in January 2024. I am looking for a PhD position in nonlinear data-driven control.

## Research Interests
- **Electro-hydraulic servo system nonlinear control:** adaptive robust control, active disturbance rejection control
- **Machine learning:** supervised learning, safe reinforcement learning
